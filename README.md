## Project

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Created with [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with dates and times. <em> `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers. This repo remains active. As such, the library used in this project may be updated at a later time. </em>

## About the Project

#### This was a daily planner project for a technical project manager and her team at an electronics manufacturer startup. The project scope sought to provide a web application daily planner which project team could use in effectively managing important project events. The application was to have a clean and polished user interface rendering responsively across a variety of devices. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
