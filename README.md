# Work Day Scheduler Project <br>

## About the Project

#### This was a simple calendar project for a technical project manager and her team at an electronics manufacturer startup. The project scope sought to provide a web app planner allowing users to save notes to each hour of the day and effectively manage important project events. The application was to run in the browser, feature dyamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery and have a clean and polished user interface rendering responsively across a variety of devices. 

#### The project was created with [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with dates and times. <em> While `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library, it is no longer supported by its developers. This repo remains active and, as such, the library used in this project may be updated at a later time if necessary. </em>

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
